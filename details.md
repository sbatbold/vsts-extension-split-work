Split! enables teams to easily continue unfinished work items into the next sprint by “splitting” the work item into a new card in the next sprint. 

## What's special about Split?
* Smart detects incomplete tasks
* Defaults split work item to the next iteration
* Maintains parent link
* Retains all attachments
* Inserts revisions of split for auditability 

## How does it work?
